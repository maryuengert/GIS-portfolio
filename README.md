## About Me
Hello world! My name is Mary Yuengert (she/her/hers) and I am a soon-to-graduate Master of Science in Public Policy and Management candidate at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College. Before coming to Heinz, I worked in both non-profit and government spaces, including working for a Senator and a Senate committee in Washington. I am most interested in social policy issues–homelessness, income inequality, hunger, and education–and developing solutions to those problems through legislation or social programs. In my free time (if I have any), I like to run, hike, cook, and tend to my growing family of houseplants.

## What I Hope to Learn
I am interested in clocking more time working with GIS and Esri products, as well as expanding on my GIS knowledge to solidfy my status as a skilled GIS user. I am hoping to use these skills in mapmaking and spatial data analysis in my new role as a federal consultant after graduating from Heinz College.
